              <span className="h1 ui header">Antipodes</span> is a collective of
              New Zealand, Australian and European jazz musicians co-led by
              pianist Luke Sweeting (Freedman Jazz Fellowship finalist 2016) and
              saxophonist Jake Baxendale. The group plays original compositions
              that emphasise melody, emotive soundscapes, and an open
              improvisational aesthetic.

              Described during their recent tour of Australia as “a great
              blowing band with dense heads, occasional free and floating
              segments, room for solos and some great grooves” (Canberra Jazz)
              this is music drawn from diverse influences – modern New York jazz
              meets Swedish indie pop and European free improvised music.
              Audiences are first drawn in by introspective, timbral
              improvisations and then set to foot-tapping with danceable beats,
              songlike melodies and fiery solos.

          Antipodes was formed after a chance meeting between Jake, Luke and
          drummer Aidan Lowe at a jam session in Berlin in 2013. Their musical
          connection became immediately apparent and they began writing and
          performing original compositions together. With Jake hailing from
          Wellington and Luke and Aidan both being native Canberrans, Antipodes
          seemed like an apt name for the far-flung trio. Joined by guitarist
          Callum Allardice (winner NZ Jazz Composition award 2016-17) in 2014,
          they have toured NZ and Australia every year to rapt audiences. The
          music draws from diverse influences – modern New York jazz meets
          Swedish indie pop and European free improvised music – that reflects
          the vibrant Berlin music scene.
